[15 Regression] GCC generate illegal riscv instruction `vsetvli	zero,zero,e64,mf4,ta,ma` with -O2 and -O3

The test case is large and I have tried my best to reduce the case.
In the assembly file I report, line 1405 `vsetvli	zero,zero,e64,mf4,ta,ma` is illegal. No `e64mf4` in current riscv vector extension.

command:
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
