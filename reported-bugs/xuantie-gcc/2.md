[14/15 Regression] Segment Fault by rvv intrinsic compilation at `-O2` and `-O3`.
(5.c in GCC)

Hi, I find a potential bug case of your Xuantie-900 GCC compiler.
This case leads to a segment fault at `-O2` and `-O3`.
The case code is attached to this email.

gcc at `-O2` and `-O3`:
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc bug.c -march=rv64gcv_zvfh -mabi=lp64d -Wno-psabi -static -O3
$ qemu-riscv64 a.out
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

gcc at `-O0`, `-O1` and `-Os`, success:
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc bug.c -march=rv64gcv_zvfh -mabi=lp64d -Wno-psabi -static -Os
$ qemu-riscv64 a.out
success.
```

llvm at any optimization, success:
```
$ clang random.c -march=rv64gcv_zvfh -mabi=lp64d -Wno-psabi -static -O3
$ qemu-riscv64 a.out
success.
```

version info:
```
$ gcc --version
